## Features

- **Identity** — On-chain username with an allowance for free transactions, verified by Proof-of-Unique-Device.
- **Personhood** — Upgrade your username to a higher allowance via Proof-of-Personhood by playing the DIM2 videocall gesture game, and earn prizes and collectables.
- **Chat** — End-to-end p2p encrypted text messaging with media (images/video) and encrypted video/audio calls.
- **Payments** — Send and receive payments by username or QR code, and directly in chat.
- **Auto-conversion** — Top up your wallet and auto-convert it into the tokens you want.
- **Built-in dApp support & sandboxing** — Explore and use any dApp, and manage its sandbox permissions.
- **dApp modalities** — Supports SPA and Chat modalities for dApps.
- **Deeplinks** — Navigate the app and dApps through links and QR codes.
- **Remote signing** — Connect to Polkadot Desktop and Polkadot Web and use Mobile as a signer.
- **Multi-device sync** — Sync contacts and chats between Polkadot Mobile and Polkadot Desktop.
- **Cloud backups** — Back up your account using Google Drive.
- **Manual backups** — Keep your account stored only in the secure enclave storage locally.
- **Customization** — Fully customizable UI design system with 5 default themes.

## Getting started

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

- **JDK 21** (Temurin) and **Android Studio**
- **Android SDK** (compileSdk 36) and **NDK r29**
- **Rust** (stable) with the Android targets and `cargo-ndk`:
  ```bash
  rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi x86_64-linux-android i686-linux-android
  cargo install cargo-ndk
  ```
- **Python 3** and **Node.js** for build helpers

Point Gradle at your SDK/NDK in `local.properties`:
```properties
sdk.dir=/path/to/android-sdk
ndk.dir=/path/to/android-ndk-r29
```

</details>

Clone the repo and open it in Android Studio:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-android-community.git
cd polkadot-android-community

# Optional: bootstrap native toolchain helpers
./developer-tools/setup.sh
```

Signing keys, `google-services.json`, and feature API keys are read from
`local.properties` or environment variables — see
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full list of variables.

Select the **gp** flavor with a debug build type and an Android 10+ device or emulator, then build and run.

The app talks to Polkadot system chains (People Chain, Asset Hub, Bulletin Chain); the chain set is
delivered via remote config, and development and nightly builds are exercised against Polkadot's
[Paseo](https://github.com/paseo-network) testnet contour.

### Build and test from the command line

```bash
# Build a debug APK (lands in app/build/outputs/apk/gp/debug/)
./gradlew assembleGpDebug

# Run unit tests
./gradlew testGpDebugUnitTest
```

The project has two flavors (`gp` with Google services, `vanilla` without) and
`debug` / `nightly` / `release` build types — e.g. `./gradlew assembleGpRelease`
for a production build (requires the release keystore and secrets).

## How it works

Polkadot Android is a self-custodial superapp: your keys are created on your phone, stay on your phone, and everything else — identity, chat, payments, apps — is built on top of them using Polkadot's public chains instead of company servers.

### What it does

1. **Keeps your keys on your device.** Your account is generated locally and encrypted with Android's hardware-backed keystore. You choose how to back it up: an encrypted backup in your own Google Drive, or no backup at all — keys stored only on the device.
2. **Gives you an on-chain name.** You register a username on Polkadot's [People Chain](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-system-chains/). Your phone proves it's a unique device, which earns you an allowance for free transactions — no tokens needed to start. Prove personhood by playing the DIM2 videocall gesture game to raise that allowance.
3. **Lets you chat without a messaging server.** Messages are end-to-end encrypted and delivered through the People Chain statement store, so there is no company inbox holding your conversations. Voice and video calls are encrypted and go directly peer-to-peer over WebRTC.
4. **Sends money to names, not addresses.** Pick a username (or scan a QR code, or pay right inside a chat) — the app resolves it to an account on-chain and sends the payment. Swaps and auto-conversion run on [Asset Hub](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-assets/)'s liquidity pools.
5. **Runs Polkadot apps inside the app.** Type a `.dot` name and the app fetches the dApp's content (published on the Bulletin Chain and addressed via DotNS) and runs it in a sandbox. Each dApp gets its own permissions — network, camera, signing, storage — that you grant and revoke per app.
6. **Works as one account across devices.** Pair with Polkadot Desktop or Polkadot Web by scanning a QR code: your phone becomes the signer that approves their transactions, and contacts and chats sync between devices over the same encrypted channels.

### What it doesn't do

- It does **not** act as a custodian of your keys or your money — the keys are stored only on your device, and nobody (including the developers) can freeze, recover, or move your funds. If you lose your device and have no cloud/written backup, the associated accounts are gone.
- It does **not** route your chats and calls through company messaging servers — messages travel through the public chain, calls go peer-to-peer.
- It is **not** a production-hardened product — treat it as a reference implementation (see the warning at the top).

### Under the hood

A modular **Kotlin** / **Jetpack Compose** codebase: features are split into `api` and `impl` modules wired with Hilt, performance-critical crypto is compiled from **Rust** via the NDK ([`bindings/`](./bindings)), and chain access goes through [substrate-sdk-android](https://github.com/novasamatech/substrate-sdk-android) (JSON-RPC, storage subscriptions, extrinsics).

This repository does not ship a hosted CI/CD pipeline. Build-time configuration
and the steps to sign and publish the app to Google Play, Firebase App
Distribution, or GitHub Releases are documented in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

Architecture conventions, module layout, and coding standards are documented in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start.

## Security

Before deploying this for real use cases, you are responsible for:

- Reviewing the code yourself — we publish a reference, not a hardened production build.
- Checking that the dependencies are up to date and free of known vulnerabilities.
- Securing your own fork or deployment environment (keys, secrets, network configuration).
- Tracking the latest commits for security fixes; older revisions are not backported.

Report vulnerabilities responsibly following [Parity's security policy](https://github.com/paritytech/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) — do not open public issues for security reports. For Parity's disclosure process and Bug Bounty programme, see [parity.io/bug-bounty](https://parity.io/bug-bounty).
