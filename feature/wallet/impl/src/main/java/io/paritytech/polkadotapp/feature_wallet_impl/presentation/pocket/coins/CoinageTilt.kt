/**
 * Turns the studio with the phone, so the light behaves as though it were fixed in the room.
 *
 * The environment the coins are lit against is defined around the coin's own space, so with the studio held
 * still the highlight sits in the same place however the phone is held. Feeding the device's own tilt back
 * in turns the studio the other way, and a coin catches the light as you tilt it, the way a real one does.
 *
 * The turn is the one rotation that carries the neutral gravity reading onto the current one, scaled into the
 * travel and reversed, so the room stays put while the phone moves under it: tilt the screen to face upward and
 * a face-on coin mirrors the ceiling. Gravity cannot see a turn about the vertical, so this is the part of the
 * phone's movement it can see. The coins themselves never move with the phone.
 *
 * It replaces a pair of angles, sideways and lean, each measured against the whole of gravity. With the phone
 * leaned back, dipping either edge also shrank the lean, so a sideways tilt came with a pitch forward that was
 * the same whichever way the edge dipped; on the dim side of the room tilting right read as tilting down.
 *
 * `TYPE_GRAVITY` needs no permission and no prompt. It is a fused reading and not present on every device,
 * so the plain accelerometer stands in; at rest the two agree, which is when the studio is allowed to move.
