 * A handoff that is reserved but not yet final.

 * Hold one from the moment the assets are chosen until whatever carries their keys is durable, then commit.
 * Where that is depends on the transport: for a chat payment it is the message row, so the commit belongs
 * inside the transaction that writes it — a crash in between would otherwise clear the reservation while a
 * peer already holds the keys.
