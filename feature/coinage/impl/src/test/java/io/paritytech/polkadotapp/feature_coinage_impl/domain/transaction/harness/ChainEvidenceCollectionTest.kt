/**
 * The three-valued read contract, asserted on the evidence itself rather than through a verdict.
 *
 * Every rule is a positive comparison against one of these values, so getting the mapping wrong does not
 * produce an error — it silently disables or silently fires a rule. Both directions have happened here:
 * a voucher's silence read as ABSENT failed entries that had executed, and a coin's absence read as UNKNOWN
 * would disable every rule that turns on a coin being gone.
