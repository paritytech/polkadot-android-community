/**
 * Random walks over coins and reorgs, checked against invariants rather than expected verdicts.
 *
 * A walk has no expected outcome, so the oracle is what the chain itself says: the fake chain behind the
 * harness is ground truth, and every claim the ledger makes is checked against it. `PENDING` is always
 * allowed — this catches a verdict that is confident and wrong, never one that is merely undecided.
 *
 * Actions are drawn from [enabledActions], which only ever offers transitions the runtime could produce.
 * The two that matter: an extrinsic is never applied outside its mortality era, and a failed dispatch
 * leaves untouched everything this subsystem reads, because `extension.rs` restores the coin in
 * `post_dispatch` and the aliases an unload would have written roll back with the dispatch. The
 * `LockedCoins` row a failure leaves behind is a map the spec puts out of scope.
