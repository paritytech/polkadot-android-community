 * resting on a block above the finalized head has to survive losing that block. `CoinageRulesTest` pins the
 * canonicality clauses of Rule 0 against hand-built evidence; these drive the same paths through a real
 * block tree, where a retracted block also takes its state and its dispatch outcome with it.
