 * Everything the rules may read about the chain, gathered for one entry against one pinned view.
 *
 * Keys are assets' on-chain identities, and every asset of the entry appears in every map — what a read did
 * not establish is [ChainPresence.UNKNOWN] rather than a missing key, so "we did not find out" is a value
 * you can see rather than an absence you have to infer.
 *
 * Every predicate over these is written in positive form and paired with its opposite, so an unknown read
 * satisfies neither side and the rule simply does not match. Negating a read would turn a network error into
 * a verdict.
