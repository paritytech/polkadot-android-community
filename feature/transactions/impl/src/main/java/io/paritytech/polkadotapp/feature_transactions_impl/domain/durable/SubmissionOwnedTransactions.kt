/**
 * Which transactions submission tracking currently owns, so the recovery pass skips exactly those and each
 * transaction has one writer at a time.
 *
 * Registration acquires inside its own database transaction, so a committed row always has an owner and a
 * pass can never evaluate a transaction the tracker is about to write. The pass asks per transaction at the
 * moment it reaches it rather than taking a copy up front — a copy would not contain one registered while
 * the pass was already running, and the pass would then evaluate it underneath its watcher.
 *
 * Deliberately volatile. A crash takes the set with it, and an empty set after restart is the correct answer
 * rather than stale state to reconcile: a durable set would strand transactions behind a watcher that no
 * longer exists. This is sound only because the client runs in one OS process — if WorkManager is ever
 * configured with `android:process`, this stops being an exclusivity mechanism.
 *
 * Ownership is one-shot per attempt: released exactly once and never re-acquired for the same bytes, not even
 * across a resubmission. A rebuilt transaction is a new attempt with a new hash, and is owned afresh.
