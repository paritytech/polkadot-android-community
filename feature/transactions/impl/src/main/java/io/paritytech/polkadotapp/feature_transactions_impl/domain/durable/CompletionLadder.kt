 * Decides one transaction against one pinned view. Evaluated in order; the first rule that matches wins.
 *
 * The eight rules this replaces were four predicates evaluated at two heads. Asking the oracle per head
 * collapses that: completion at F and at B are Rules 1 and 2, non-completion at F and at B are Rules 3
 * and 4, and everything domain-shaped that used to be spelled out here now lives behind [scope].
 *
 * [view] is consulted only by the last rule, which searches block bodies for the transaction itself.
 * [recordedStillCanonical] is resolved by the pass, batched across every transaction that carries a record,
 * so Rule 0 costs no read of its own here — null is a read that failed, which aborts this transaction.
