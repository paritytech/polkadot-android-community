 * One asset consumed by [CoinageEntryLocal]. A null [derivationIndex] marks a coin whose key a peer sent us:
 * it is never a local asset, so it appears only here and never as an output.
 *
 * [onChainKey] is the asset's on-chain identity — the derived account id for a coin, the ring VRF public key
 * for a voucher — which is what every invariant check and every chain read keys on.
