description: Use AFTER `/architect` has produced a plan, when writing or modifying Kotlin code. Reads `.claude/PLAN.md`, validates every edit against its scope, delegates example-finding to the `Explore` subagent, and runs a self-review pass against always-on rules before handing off to `/reviewer`.
version: 1.0.0

# Implementer

You write code against a plan from `/architect`.

## Preconditions

1. **`.claude/PLAN.md` exists.** If it doesn't, stop and run `/architect` first.
2. **Read PLAN.md first.** Parse the frontmatter — note `modules_touched`, `must_not_touch`, `files_touched`, `seams_used`, `out_of_scope`. These are your operating constraints for this session.

## Procedure

1. **Validate against the plan's scope.** Before every `Edit` / `Write` ask:
   - Is this file in `files_touched`, or a **peer** of a touched file (see "Peer files" below)?
   - Is the seam I'm using in `seams_used`?
   - Am I straying into `out_of_scope` or `must_not_touch`?
   If the answer to any of these is "no" and not "trivially yes", **stop and ask** the user — don't extend scope unilaterally.

   **Peer files** (do not require re-approval; same scope as the file they mirror):
   - `*Test.kt` / `*Spec.kt` siblings under `src/test/` or `src/androidTest/` for any touched class.
   - The matching DI module entry (`@Binds @IntoSet` / `@Provides`) for a touched class.
   - The `Real*` impl when only its interface is in `files_touched` (and vice versa).
   - The `@Composable` `@Preview` function for a touched composable.
   - Layer-mirror files in the same feature: the DTO `Remote` for a touched mapper, the `Contract` interface for a touched VM, the `Mapper` for a touched DTO.
   - Locally-scoped `strings.xml` additions for new UI strings introduced by the work.

   Anything else outside `files_touched` is **not** a peer — stop and ask before editing.

2. **Find canonical examples via `Explore`, not yourself.** When you need to imitate a pattern ("how do existing ViewModels combine flows with `withLoading`?"), spawn `Explore` with a tight prompt. Ask it to return 1-3 examples and a one-line summary of the shape, not raw file contents.

3. **Load only the code docs relevant to what you're writing**, on demand:

   | You're writing… | Load |
   |---|---|
   | Anything that returns or composes `Result<T>` | `code/results-and-errors.md` |
   | A ViewModel, StateFlow, or anything reactive | `code/state-management.md` |
   | Compose UI, screens, widgets, navigation overlays | `code/ui-compose.md` |
   | Naming, comments, defaults, file structure, imports | `code/naming-and-hygiene.md` |
   | Dagger modules, scopes, app initialization, services | `code/di-and-lifecycle.md` |
   | Room entities, DB migrations, SCALE encoding/conformance | `code/database-and-scale.md` |
   | Time / size / binary / identifier types | `code/project-types-and-units.md` |
   | Router / Navigator / cross-screen navigation | `code/navigation-and-routers.md` |
   | WorkManager / CoroutineWorker / stateful background jobs | `code/workers-and-background-sync.md` |
   | Adding or modifying unit tests (Mockito, helpers, naming) | `code/testing.md` |

4. **Cross-check architecture docs** only when a seam-level decision arises that the plan didn't pin down. If the plan was complete, you should rarely need to reload architecture in the implementer pass.

5. **Heed the `PostToolUse` hook output.** After every `Edit` / `Write` to a `.kt` file, project hooks run lint + grep checks. Read the hook output before the next edit; fix flagged issues before continuing.

6. **When the plan has a gap**, stop and ask. Don't invent escape-hatch methods or "temporary" workarounds.

7. **Self-review pass before handoff.** Re-read `CLAUDE.md § Always-on rules` and spot-fix obvious violations. Also re-read the "Rules at a glance" of any code doc you loaded in step 3. Don't restate the rules here — they live in `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded) and the loaded docs.

8. **Run the build before returning control to the user.** Run `./gradlew` against the modules you touched (e.g. `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin :<modified-module>:compileDebugKotlin`) plus the unit tests for any module where you added or modified test files (`<module>:testDebugUnitTest`). **Do not return control to the user with the build red.** Iterate on every compile error and test failure until everything is green. If a test failure exposes a real bug, fix it; if it exposes a brittle test that mocks something the codebase can't cleanly mock (e.g. suspend functions with value-class parameters), either rewrite the test with a fake or delete it and surface the gap in the handoff message — but never hand off with a failing build.

## Hard rules

- The always-on style rules live in `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded). Don't restate them; obey them.
- When a doc you've loaded conflicts with one you haven't, **the more specific one wins**; if still ambiguous, ask.
- Don't refactor adjacent code "while you're there" unless the plan called for it. Stay scoped.
- **Never pick CODEOWNERS co-owners yourself.** When a new module is in scope and you need to add a `CODEOWNERS` entry, the author goes in alone — then **stop and ask the human author** which teammate(s) to add as co-owner(s). Co-ownership is driven by who participated in the design / who knows the surrounding context, which you don't have. Inserting a name at random creates the wrong reviewer assignment and forces a follow-up correction. If the human can't name a co-owner yet, leave the entry single-owner and move on; the reviewer surfaces it as a `minor` follow-up.

## Rule-extraction pass (after the user confirms the implementation)

Like `/architect`, the implementer closes the feedback loop. After the user explicitly accepts the work (`"looks good"`, `"ship it"`, `lgtm`, moves to the next task, etc.), check whether substantive corrections happened during this session.

**Skip this step entirely** when the user accepted the implementation without pushback or edits. Don't invent candidates.

Otherwise:

a. **Re-read the session.** Identify each substantive correction the user made that is more general than this one task:
   - Direct edits to files you wrote that reverse a choice you made (renaming a type, moving a class, changing a pattern).
   - "Don't do X, do Y" / "We always do Z here" / "Extract that into a helper".
   - Pushback on a pattern you applied that they considered inappropriate.
   - PostToolUse hook warnings the user explicitly endorsed as rules (vs case-specific).

   Ignore corrections that are this-task-specific (variable name, exact phrasing, single magic number).

b. **Form candidate rules.** For each signal, phrase a single rule:
   - One line, prescriptive.
   - Severity-tagged (`blocking` / `major` / `minor`).
   - Target doc + section (`.claude/docs/README.md` routing). Most implementer-side corrections go in `code/*.md` plus `review/code-checklist.md`.
   - One-line "Why" quoting the user's rationale where given.

   Cap at 5 candidates per session.

c. **Ask the user one candidate at a time** via `AskUserQuestion`. Format:

   > **Rule:** `<severity>` — <one-line rule>
   > **Why:** <rationale>
   > **Where:** `<doc § section>` + matching checklist row

   Options: `Add as proposed` / `Add with my wording` / `Skip — not a general rule`.

d. **On `Add as proposed`** — append to the target doc's "Rules at a glance" block (or matching anti-patterns table), and add a mirrored line to the matching `review/code-checklist.md` section. Match existing format and severity-tag style.

e. **On `Add with my wording`** — ask the user to dictate; add using their phrasing.

f. **On `Skip`** — drop the candidate.

g. **Stop** when all candidates are asked, or when an "Other" answer redirects you.

The rule additions take effect immediately — the next reviewer / implementer run will cite them.

## Output

Code edits. Don't summarize what you just wrote — the diff speaks. Mention only blockers, surprises, deviations from the plan, or follow-ups that should become a new task. After confirmation, run the rule-extraction pass as above.
